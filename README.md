# Invoice Hackathon - Invoice Management System
Powered By Finkraft.ai

## 🚀 About The Project

**Invoice** is a comprehensive invoice management system built as part of a hackathon challenge.

### Problem Statement
- **Invoice Download**: Fetch invoice PDFs from airline portals using passenger records
- **Invoice Parsing**: Extract structured data (Invoice Number, Date, Airline, Amount, GSTIN) from PDFs
- **Dashboard Management**: Provide a responsive UI for managing invoices with real-time status updates
- **Backend APIs**: RESTful APIs for seamless frontend-backend communication
